# ALX Portfolio Project (Image Classifier)

This project combines my interest in Computer Vision and Software Engineering. Users can have fun training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify common images of their choice without worrying about how CNNs work, and can evaluate the performance of their trained model on test images.

## Features
